I love coding (currently Python; also learning Java) and want to offer my abilities and passion to a tech company doing meaningful work. I am a quick learner, work well in teams, am an experienced public speaker, and want to change my little part of the world to make it all it can be.

I was first introduced to computer programming in high school. My first programming language was machine language. Next I upgraded to assembly language, which offered slightly more capabilities than machine language. I ended my high school years learning basic.

These first years sparked my interest in computers and technology and spurred me to begin studies in electrical engineering studies. In these university years I learned Fortran and improved my math, physics, and engineering skills.

At this point I felt a call to ministry and have been in that career path for over 20 years now. I grew in values, integrity, communication skills (including public speaking), and leadership.

During these years I still had interest in computers and technology. I would purchase used personal computers and run Linux to make file, print, and email servers, and turning one into a wireless router.

Recently I have retired from ministry and again have returned to my love of computers and coding. I'm self-taught in Python, including Django, Pyside6, Pytest, Click, Plotly, and other libraries.

I am expanding the breadth of my learning with design patterns, algorithms, clean coding, pragmatic programming, and other topics. Also, I am familiar with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently learning Java.

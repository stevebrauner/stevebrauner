### About Me

I want to use my Python/Django coding skills in a tech company doing meaningful work through serving their customers/users.

Recently, I retired from ministry and again have returned to my love of computers and coding. I'm self-taught in Python, and Django. I am expanding the breadth of my learning with design patterns, algorithms, and other topics. I am also familiar with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I am constantly growing my coding skills (e.g., beginning to learn Java and C++).

My life experiences have taught me many useful skills. At university I began studies in electrical engineering, which improved my math and engineering skills. During my years in ministry, I grew in values, integrity, communication skills, and leadership. I am a quick learner, work well in teams, and want to bring abundance to the world.
